### Day 1: July 15, Wednesday.

**Today's Progress**: Some bug fixes/edits in my previous projects. Then I've done 5 first steps in the D3 tutorial on FCC (I need it for my project).

**Time Spent**: 2 hours.

**Thoughts**: When I started (about 3 PM) I couldn't focus well so I looked at my old projects and made some small changes/bug fixes. Then in the night, I was playing chess and when I started feeling focused, I started learning D3 on FCC. It was good I think, I was writing notes and it helped me to understand things much faster.

### Day 2: July 16, Thursday.

**Today's Progress**: I've done 9 steps in fcc D3 cert. I finally understand callback functions.

**Time Spent**: 1 hour 30 minutes.

**Thoughts**: I started coding too late because I was snoozing it for the later. Don't do this tomorrow.

### Day 3: July 17, Friday.

**Today's Progress**: Gave up D3 (too much for my simple purposes). I was playing with apexchart.js and made a simple chart for my project. .

**Time Spent**: 2 hours 30 minutes.

**Thoughts**: In the afternoon when I was trying to understand and make something with D3, it was very stressful and I couldn't understand it and concentrate on it. I decided to give up D3, because it is too complicated for my simple purposes.. and picked up apexchart.js instead, which seems pretty simple. I don't want to spend too much time on this.


### Day 1: July 22, Wednesday. (I missed 2 days in a row, so I am resetting)

### Day 4: July 25, Saturday.

### Day 11: August 2 , Sunday.

### Day 13: August 4 , Tusday.

**Today's Progress**: Learned and used ES6 modules in my project. Finished a function, which adds a new todo to the data and calls a function imported from the module (creating html elements is too messy in vanilla js, let's hide it :D), which renders todo to the DOM.

**Time Spent**: 3 hours.

**Thoughts**: Spent a lot of time with small problems today. But it was fun :) and I made some steps forward again. Feels really good

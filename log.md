### Day 1: March 12, Friday.

**Today's Progress**: 
- I rewrote the 404-page by doing it mobile-first and then desktop version.
- THen I refactored the big part of it and make it cleaner

**Time Spent**:
- About 2.5 hours doing and 2.5 hours learning stuff about how to write clean css, BEM, responsive design etc.. I did not put that in practice yet. I also checked some other's people code on 404-page.

**Thoughts**: 
- It's still not responsive like it should be. Yeah it works great on desktop and phones, but not as good on tablets. Code is still not very good.



### Day 2: March 12, Friday.

**Today's Progress**: 
-I don't remember much, but I think that I was working on the 404-page (cleaning code, making it responsive again)

**Time Spent**:
- At least 1 hour

**Thoughts**: 



### Day 3: March 14, Sunday.

**Today's Progress**: 
- I started working on Interior Consultant Page
- I was reading about stuff and watching tutorials about css

**Time Spent**:
- I don't remember much but I think that it was at least 3 hours, I was so tired in the end (night) that I did not even do a report :D

**Thoughts**: 



### Day 4: March 15, Monday.

**Today's Progress**: 
- I learned how to use BEM methodology and used that in my project (and then stopped using that, I don't like it) and how to write cleaner css in general
- Made some progress on the Interior Consultant Page. I wrote full HTML with class names and then worked on the navbar (not finished yet)

**Time Spent**:
- 3 hours

**Thoughts**: 
- I started really late (at 11 PM), but my focus was really good. I was tired and not most efficient, but I was focused :) And I really enjoyed that. I forgot about time, zero distractions, just me and my thoughts.



### Day 5: March 16, Tuesday.

**Today's Progress**: 
- I made some progress on Interior Consultant Website

**Time Spent**:

**Thoughts**:

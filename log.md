### Day 1: July 15, Wednesday.

**Today's Progress**: Some bug fixes/edits in my previous projects. Then I've done 5 first steps in the D3 tutorial on FCC (I need it for my project).

**Time Spent**: 2 hours.

**Thoughts**: When I started (about 3 PM) I couldn't focus well so I looked at my old projects and made some small changes/bug fixes. Then in the night, I was playing chess and when I started feeling focused, I started learning D3 on FCC. It was good I think, I was writing notes and it helped me to understand things much faster.

### Day 2: July 16, Thursday.

**Today's Progress**: I've done 9 steps in fcc D3 cert. I finally understand callback functions.

**Time Spent**: 1 hour 30 minutes.

**Thoughts**: I started coding too late because I was snoozing it for the later. Don't do this tomorrow.

### Day 3: July 17, Friday.

**Today's Progress**: Gave up D3 (too much for my simple purposes). I was playing with apexchart.js and made a simple chart for my project. .

**Time Spent**: 2 hours 30 minutes.

**Thoughts**: In the afternoon when I was trying to understand and make something with D3, it was very stressful and I couldn't understand it and concentrate on it. I decided to give up D3, because it is too complicated for my simple purposes.. and picked up apexchart.js instead, which seems pretty simple. I don't want to spend too much time on this.

### Day 3: July 24, Friday.

### Day 4: July 25, Saturday.

**Today's Progress**: Almost solved Sorted Union algorithm challenge on freecodecamp.

**Time Spent**: 1 hour.

**Thoughts**: I started too late, in the beginning, it was ok but then I had to take a pause and after the pause, I wasn't able to finish that... I had to start waking up earlier & start coding earlier.

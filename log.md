### Day 1: March 12, Friday.

**Today's Progress**: 
- I rewrote the 404-page by doing it mobile-first and then desktop version.
- THen I refactored the big part of it and make it cleaner

**Time Spent**:
- About 2.5 hours doing and 2.5 hours learning stuff about how to write clean css, BEM, responsive design etc.. I did not put that in practice yet. I also checked some other's people code on 404-page.

**Thoughts**: 
- It's still not responsive like it should be. Yeah it works great on desktop and phones, but not as good on tablets. Code is still not very good.

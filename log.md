### Day 1: July 15, Wednesday.

**Today's Progress**: Some bug fixes/edits in my previous projects. Then I've done 5 first steps in the D3 tutorial on FCC (I need it for my project).

**Time Spent**: 2 hours.

**Thoughts**: When I started (about 3 PM) I couldn't focus well so I looked at my old projects and made some small changes/bug fixes. Then in the night, I was playing chess and when I started feeling focused, I started learning D3 on FCC. It was good I think, I was writing notes and it helped me to understand things much faster.

### Day 2: July 16, Thursday.

**Today's Progress**: I've done 9 steps in fcc D3 cert. I finally understand callback functions.

**Time Spent**: 1 hour 30 minutes.

**Thoughts**: I started coding too late because I was snoozing it for the later. Don't do this tomorrow.

### Day 3: July 17, Friday.

**Today's Progress**: Gave up D3 (too much for my simple purposes). I was playing with apexchart.js and made a simple chart for my project. .

**Time Spent**: 2 hours 30 minutes.

**Thoughts**: In the afternoon when I was trying to understand and make something with D3, it was very stressful and I couldn't understand it and concentrate on it. I decided to give up D3, because it is too complicated for my simple purposes.. and picked up apexchart.js instead, which seems pretty simple. I don't want to spend too much time on this.


### Day 1: July 22, Wednesday. (I missed 2 days in a row, so I am resetting)

**Today's Progress**: I made some progress on my weather app. (all on github).

### Day 3: July 24, Friday.

**Today's Progress**: Day 3 of #100DaysOfCode Mostly thinking about the back end for my weather app (what tech to use, how will it all work together), and writing it down. It cleared my mind :).

**Thoughts**: Good hour :).


### Day 4: July 25, Saturday.

**Today's Progress**: Almost solved Sorted Union algorithm challenge on freecodecamp.

**Time Spent**: 1 hour.

**Thoughts**: I started too late, in the beginning, it was ok but then I had to take a pause and after the pause, I wasn't able to finish that... I had to start waking up earlier & start coding earlier.


### Day 5: July 26, Sunday.

**Today's Progress**: Finished Sorted Union algorithm challenge on freecodecamp. Some pseudo coding for my weather app project. 

**Time Spent**: 1 hour.

**Thoughts**: :) 


### Day 6: July 27, Monday.

**Today's Progress**: Started a project called memory game. Made a HTML & CSS part of it.

**Time Spent**: 4 hours.

**Thoughts**: Interesting day. My internet connection didn't work, so I had to take a pause with the weather station and start building something when I don't need a internet connection :D


### Day 7: July 28, Tuesday.

**Today's Progress**: Made an essential javascript part of the memory game. 

**Time Spent**: 3 hours.

**Thoughts**: Finally! I started right when I woke up! :) This project is so fun


### Day 8: July 29, Wednesday.

**Today's Progress**: Cleaned some code. Wrote a function which generates an array containing random numbers (numbers can't repeat) for my project.

**Time Spent**: 2 hours.

**Thoughts**: Again! I started early. Not a lot of work today, but still good and I enjoyed it :)


### Day 9: July 30, Thursday.

### (31. july, skipped one day)

### Day 10: August 1 , Saturday.

**Today's Progress**: Finished memory game (it sucks, but it was really fun to make and I learned something new :) ) Link here:  https://lukashanak.github.io/memory-game/

**Time Spent**: 2 hours.

**Thoughts**: I started a little bit too late, but it was really good :) I was listening to the classical essentials playlist on spotify :D 


### Day 11: August 2 , Sunday.

**Today's Progress**: I was watching some tutorials and was playing with some stuff, then I was really tired to code so I didn't do an actual work..

**Time Spent**: 2 hours.

**Thoughts**: idk :D


### Day 12: August 3 , Monday.

**Today's Progress**: I refactored, basically deleted and wrote new js code for my todo list app. Finally a readable code :)

**Time Spent**: 2 hours.

**Thoughts**: It was really fun :) I started a really late, it was really hard to start and get into the flow.. and then I couldn't go away from my computer and stop coding :D


### Day 13: August 4 , Tusday.

**Today's Progress**: Learned and used ES6 modules in my project. Finished a function, which adds a new todo to the data and calls a function imported from the module (creating html elements is too messy in vanilla js, let's hide it :D), which renders todo to the DOM.

**Time Spent**: 3 hours.

**Thoughts**: Spent a lot of time with small problems today. But it was fun :) and I made some steps forward again. Feels really good



### Day 14: August 5 , Wednesday.

**Today's Progress**: Great day! I refactored a HTML & CSS && function for creating a HTML DOM in my todo-list app.

**Time Spent**: 4 hours.

**Thoughts**: Today was a really good day :) Yeah! I am so happy :D 


### (August 6, skipped so I can't miss a day next 14 days)


### Day 15: August 7 , Friday.

**Today's Progress**: Started using a local storage for my todo-list app, so todos are always saved even if you close the tab. (works on mobile devices too) Link here: https://lukashanak.github.io/js-todoapp/index.html

**Time Spent**: 1.5 hours.

**Thoughts**: I just sited down. Turned on the Inception music playlist and started working. This is how magic works :D 


### Day 16: August 8 , Saturday.

**Today's Progress**: Studying how HTTP works, choosing between PHP / NodeJS (Node won), reading eloquent js.. Not a good day, but I need to learn & do some back end in order to continue with my weather app.

**Time Spent**: 2 hours.

**Thoughts**: I started too late. I was procrastinating, because I didn't know what exactly to do. I have to sit down and study for many hours next day and actually make some, even a small project / just write some code.



### Day 17: August 9 , Sunday.

**Today's Progress**: Spent a lot of time looking around. I jumped into the node.js but then realized that I don't know prerequisites/principles. I will have to study for a few days.

**Time Spent**: 3 hours.

**Thoughts**: Bad day.. :D I forget how to learn... I was just reading an articles like an idiot and didn't understant the stuff properly.. Then I remembered how I was learning sooner. So I connected the second monitor. On the left, I had a learning resources and on the rigt, I had a google docs. And I started explaining the things in my own words. This always worked pretty well for me.. So my plan for tomorrow is: Make a plan for learning a node.js and start learning it, take notes... so you can start building your back end as soon as possible :)



### Day 18: August 10 , Monday.

**Today's Progress**: Learning new stuff and concepts, like asynchronous programming etc.

**Time Spent**: 2 hours.

**Thoughts**: Boring. I did not enjoyed this day and made a small progress, but I will keep going.


### Day 19: August 11 , Tuesday.

**Today's Progress**: Learning ES6 features like rest, object desctructing, methods like map()...

**Time Spent**: 2 hours.

**Thoughts**: Better than yesterday.


### August 12, I tried many times, couldn't focus, tired, I don't understand what is going on :/ I'll try to keep going no matter how I feel


### Day 20: August 13 , Thursday.

**Today's gaol**: Make a fuck*** plan. Exactly whad do you need to do to become a front end dev. What skills do you need to have. What you actually know and what you need to learn. What proejct do you need tot build? It doesn't have to be perfect, just write some plan. You need to see what you have to do, like in the MMORPG game. Write a post on freecodecamp forum. Introduce yourself and find an accountability partner. This is the mindset part. It will save you a lot of deppresion and time in the future.
Second part. Start some project. Create a process from the start to the end. Then start realizing it. 4 pomodoros, no excuses. You need to see the f**** results, then you will feel motivated.

**Today's Progress**: Missed previous day. I toke one step back and made a plan. I feel much better now. I started a memory game again, now I'll make sure that it will look and work really good.

**Time Spent**: 3

**Thoughts**: I feel much better. It's going to be fun again. I just need to have a plan (I have it now) and see the results. Nothing makes me feel mroe depressed than when I don't see progress. Just-in time and project-based learning is my new best friend :)
